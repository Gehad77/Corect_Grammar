# Correct Grammar Errors

In this code, we have three main sections:

- Audio-to-Text Processing:

We initialize the WhisperModel, which is a pre-trained model for transcribing audio to text.
The out() function uses the model to transcribe an audio file and returns the recognized text.
Text-to-Speech Conversion:

We have two options for text-to-speech conversion: gTTS and pyttsx3.

The convert_text_to_speech() function uses the gTTS library to convert text to speech and save it as an audio file.
Grammar Correction and Audio Conversion:

We initialize the HappyTextToText model for grammar correction using the T5 architecture.

The convert_audio_to_speech() function combines the audio processing, grammar correction, and audio conversion steps.

It transcribes the input audio file to text, applies grammar correction to the recognized text, converts the corrected text to speech, and saves it as an output audio file.

The final audio file is downloaded using the files.download() function.

Make sure to adjust the code and import any required dependencies according to your specific environment and setup.
